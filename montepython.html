            <h4>Desription</h4>
            <p><tt class="small">Monte&nbsp;Python</tt> is a Monte Carlo code for
            Cosmological Parameter extraction. It contains likelihood codes of
            most recent experiments, and interfaces with the Boltzmann code <tt
            class="small">class</tt> for computing the cosmological
            observables.</p>
            <p>Several sampling methods are available: Metropolis-Hastings,
            Nested Sampling (through <a href="">MultiNest</a>), EMCEE (through <a
                href="">CosmoHammer</a>) and Importance Sampling.</p>

            <h4>Installation</h4>
            <p> The whole procedure is detailled <a
                href="http://monte-python.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html">there</a>.
            You will need Python 2 (from 2.5 to 2.7). The Python packages will be
            installed automatically by the installation script.</p>
            <p> If you have <i>git</i>, the easiest way to install the code is to
            simply issue</p>
            <pre class="text-left">
git clone https://github.com/baudren/montepython_public
cd montepython_public
python setup.py install --user</pre>
            <p> This will create a <var>montepython_public</var> directory, and
            install the required Python modules. You will still have to install
            <tt class="small">class</tt> by yourself, though.</p>

                      Added a new BAO data point from Ross et. al. 2014,

                      the previous ones. Notice that all reference to the

                      the data points are stored as if computed with the true

                      98 formula. Thanks to Antonio Cuesta for his help in
                      annihilating this issue.
                    <li>You can now combine parameters when analyzing (at your
                      own risk, beware of the priors), using a new dictionary
                      in the <tt>extra plot file</tt>.
                    <li>Unified scheme for handling complex parameters from
                      CLASS. You can now specify for instance
                      <tt>m_ncdm__1</tt>,
                      <tt>m_ncdm__2</tt> as running parameters, and they will
                      be treated correctly. Note the double underscore in the
                      names!
                    <li>It is now possible to add derived parameters that were
                      not chosen before the run began.
                    <li>added a <tt>--silent</tt> option to avoid printing on-screen
                      the steps in parameter space.

                    <li style="margin-top:0px;"> You can now use
                    <tt>MultiNest</tt> (credits F. Feroz and M. Hobson), and the
                    <tt>CosmoHammer</tt> (credits J. Akeret and S. Seehars)
                    within Monte Python. Both modules are commented, and their
                    documentation is available as before on the automatically
                    generated documentation.<br>

                    MultiNest has been wrapped in Python in the (credits J.
                    Buchner, see <a
                        href="https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest"
                        target="new">PyMultiNest package</a>), and the interface
                    with Monte Python has been mostly done by Jesus Torrado. It
                    is an excellent tool for exploring weirdly shaped posterior
                    distribution, and multi-modal ones (a feature is being tested
                    of automatically extracting the different modes and creating
                    separate Monte Python folders). It also computes the evidence
                    of a model.<br>

                    The CosmoHammer was implemented with the help of its creators
                    in ETH, and now its basic functionnalities working. It is a
                    great tool to make use of gigantic clusters.<br>

                    <em>Note that both the use of CosmoHammer and PyMultiNest through
                    Monte Python is restricted to their specific licenses, which
                    includes citing their original paper(s). See their respective
                    website for proper usage.</em><br>

                    <li> Finally implemented an over sampling scheme, that allows
                    a fast running with likelihoods with a high number of
                    nuisance parameters. The user can oversample each block of
                    nuisance parameters at a rate of his choice. See the example
                    in base.param, and don't forget to call the code with the
                    option <tt>-j fast</tt>.

                    <li> Repackaging: the whole folder now should behave more
                    like a proper python package. This included renaming the
                    `code' directory into `montepython', and moving the
                    `likelihoods' folder inside this new `montepython'. Also,
                    considering a likelihood named `lkl', instead of following
                    the previous structure:
                    <tt>likelihoods/lkl/lkl.py</tt> and <tt>.data</tt>,
                    you should now use:
                    <tt>montepython/likelihoods/lkl/__init__.py</tt> and
                    <tt>lkl.data</tt>.
                    If you implemented a custom likelihood, you should obviously
                    update it to this standard. Note that the syntax to import
                    the module likelihood_class has changed inside the
                    likelihoods.

                    <li> New WiggleZ analysis (credits Signe Riemer, David
                    Parkinson) working and tested, apart from the use of the
                    nuisance parameter P0 (WIP)

                    <li> Update of the BAO data from 2013 (called `bao_boss`,
                    reference in the data/ folder), and added the data from
                    CFHTLens and Planck_SZ measurement.

                    <li> First version of the test module, with basic
                    functionalities being checked.  It needs the `nose' Python
                    package to run.  Notably, there is a test listing all the
                    needed functions that the cosmological code must have in
                    order to work with Monte Python - this can be a good
                    guideline to implement a wrapper around another Boltzmann
                    code.

                    <li> Convention of path changed to comply with Python
                    standards. This might affect your modified likelihoods (you
                    should now use the command os.path.join to create paths.

                    comments in the code have been replaced by docstrings,
                    automatically extracted to create a website. You can now
                    navigate the different functions, see the dependencies, see
                    the source code in one convenient place.
                    <li> Renamed both <tt>io.py</tt> and <tt>parser.py</tt> into <tt>io_mp.py</tt> and
                    <tt>parser_mp.py</tt> (mp for Monte Python). It was conflicting with
                    some installed packages of python, both being some very often
                    used names.
                    <li> Removed the comparison between input param and log.param:
                    always choose the latest.
                    <li> Changed the architecture of analyze.py file. The whole thing
                    is no longer a class, but instead a collection of functions.
                    To exchange information between these functions, a new class
                    called `information` has been created.
                    <li> Removed the common.py file, merging its content (lockfile
                    system) with io_mp.py
                    <li> Transfered the log_flag from being an indendent quantity
                    being exchanged between data and likelihoods to a proper
                    attribute of the data class. Since no comparison is done
                    any-more, there was no reason to keep it this way anymore.

                    Added the following likelihoods: SPT full data (called
                    <tt>spt_2500</tt> in the likelihood directory), compilation
                    of BAO scale data (called <tt>bao</tt>), compilation of
                    quasar time-delay data (called <tt>timedelay</tt>)
                    <li> To speed up the production of plots, you can play with a
                    new extension defining the print-out format: use the
                    command-line option <tt>-ext png</tt>, or <tt>eps</tt>, or
                    <tt>pdf</tt> (from the fastest to the slowest format).
                    <li> Added a lockfile system, that should prevent a file from
                    being written simultaneously by two programs, when launching
                    several different runs at the same time.  
                    <li> Changed a detail in the input file syntax, concerning
                    parameter prior edges. To leave the prior edge undefined, you
                    can still use "-1" as before, or "None". But if your prior
                    edge is really minus one (for instance for w), you can write
                    "-1."
                    <li>  Function <tt>cosmo_update_arguments()</tt> modified for
                    better readability and simpler use (this function allows to
                    rename or remap input parameters at each step before passing
                    them to CLASS). The syntax pattern "<tt>try, except</tt>" is
                    not needed anymore.
